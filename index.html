                    I'm a Senior at the Univeristy of Maryland, College Park studying Information Science. 
                    My passion for technology, how it works, and how people interact with it has lead me into the technology field. 
                    It was when I was working with hardware and software for a project, that I discovered how truly facinating programming can be. 
                    I have ventured into learning and working with new languages, data structures, operating systems, and databases to apply them to create innovative and exciting projects. 
                    This all has led me to pursing a path in Software Engineering where I will be able to use enjoyment of programing and put it to great use. 
                    Currently I am refining my web development skills in order to make better and more user-friendly websites.
